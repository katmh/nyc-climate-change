## Conclusion/call to action

What obstacles might hinder Local Law 97's implementation? Just how stringent are the emissions targets and timeline? What help can burdened landlords receive? And we can't look at sustainability in isolation—how does this law fit into larger contexts of the economy and society?

The main criticism of Local Law 97 is that too many buildings are exempt, placing unfair pressure on those that must comply. Aside from the usual suspects (such as hospitals, places of worship, public housing, and energy plants), buildings with any rent-regulated units—even just one—are exempt. This means that a whopping 40 percent of residential units must "implement a prescriptive package of energy savings measures" instead.
