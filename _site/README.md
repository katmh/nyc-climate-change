# Understanding NYC’s Boldest Climate Change 

> [nyc-climate-change.now.sh](https://nyc-climate-change.now.sh/)

A data story about [Local Law 97](https://www.urbangreencouncil.org/content/projects/all-about-nycs-historic-building-emissions-law), a major piece of legislation that requires large buildings (which contribute 1/3 of NYC’s greenhouse gas emissions) to meet increasingly emissions limits in 2024 and 2030. Several categories of buildings, including affordable housing, are exempt.

Since this law sets a precedent for cities everywhere, we wanted to **see if its benefits and burdens are equitably distributed**. Additionally, we wanted to explore one of Local Law 97’s biggest criticisms: that too many buildings are exempt, placing undue burdens on those that aren’t. **So, who really is impacted? Who is exempt?**

Through our initial analysis, we found that **exempt residential buildings are concentrated in the whitest, richest, most educated & least rent-burdened parts of NYC**.

## Tech Stack

We made a static website using Jekyll (for features like modularity, variables, etc). The built site is in the `_site` directory.

We used Mapbox, D3, and Scrollama for the visualization and scrollytelling.
